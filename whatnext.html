				<h3>I was thinking about my website and it seemed to be not that good as I wanted it to be.</h3>
				<h3>Actually as much as I tried to make it dark and minimal'ish, I couldn't do it. It's not my now. I grew up a lot, since I started to develop this web-site, and now I realised that it's not what my heart wants to see.</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>Let me introduce myself properly...</h3>
				<h3>Hi, I'm Nikhil (aka ikx) and it's nice to meet you all.<br>I love lot of weeaboo stuff and also lots of dark memes and sysadmin stuff.<br>But now I understand that I'm not that stuff. I love it but it not defines me.</h3>
				<h3>So it was a bit hard decision which I made. I will redisign my site to, what I think, will be best for me. But more importantly to my heart.</h3>
				<h3>I will keep that dark story which I'm creating but it'll be not main content as it was to the present day.</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>Once again... Thank you all who leaved comments or loved my site. We will meet again, in the world with no sadness.</h3>
				<br>
				<h3><a href="index.html">Go back?</a></h3>
