		<h1>Happiness</h1>
		<h2>
			I was thinking about things like happiness, sadness, future and what things was.<br>
			There are plenty of feelings that I can't reach right now. By the way how can I manage or sort my thoughts when they're almost dead now?. I think I started to feel good but... I'm not.<br>
			Well, here's the deal. How can I be happy with myself?<br>
			There's no way I can now...<br>
			I was envy about people who just leaved their lives and I thought that I can live like that too. But I failed.<br>
			Going back to dark feelings now is different then it was before. Now I'm different and it defines my soul and my mind. But I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back anymore... I DON'T WANT TO LIVE LIKE THAT. . .<br>
			How should I live?
