			I love FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), I like music, and I like talking to other people
			<h3>I'm an explorer, I like to explore different minds(ets) and looking at things from the perspective of others</h3><hr>
			<hr><h3>I strive to be different, I've always wanted to be special, different from others, sticking out from the masses.</h3><hr>

					<h3>I was thinking about my website and it seemed to be not that good as I wanted it to be.</h3>
					<h3>Actually as much as I tried to make it dark and minimal'ish, I couldn't do it. It's not my now. I grew up a lot, since I started to develop this web-site, and now I realised that it's not what my heart wants to see.</h3>
					<hr><hr><h3>I love lot of crazy stuff and also lots of dark memes and sysadmin stuff.<hr>But now I understand that I'm not that stuff. I love it but it not defines me.</h3>
					<h3>So it was a bit hard decision which I made. I will redisign my site to, what I think, will be best for me. But more importantly to my heart.</h3>
					<h3>I will keep that dark story which I'm creating but it'll be not main content as it was to the present day.</h3>
